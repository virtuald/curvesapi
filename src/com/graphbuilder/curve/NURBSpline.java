/**
<p>General implementation of the Non-Uniform Rational B-spline or NURB-Spline.  The main advantage
of the NURB-Spline over the B-Spline is the ability to represent conic sections.  To do this, a curve
with degree of 2 is used.  Figure 1 contains examples of conic arcs.

<p>NURB-Splines can also be used to generate circles as shown in figure 2.

<p><center><img align="center" src="doc-files/nurbs2.gif"/></center>

<p>As seen in the figures, every control-point has an associated weight value.  The weight-values control
how much relative pull each control-point has on the curve.  If the weight-value is 0, then the associated
point will have no affect on the curve.  If a point has an associated weight of 0, but the curve is expected
to pass through that point, then it is likely that the result of evaluation will be the origin.  All weights
must be >= 0.
